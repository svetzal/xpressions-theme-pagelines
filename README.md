Xpressions Sub-Theme for Pagelines DMS
======================================

This is a sub-theme for the Xpressions group in Toronto, to be used in
conjunction with the Pagelines DMS system.

Currently, it really doesn't contain many visuals, but the following
functionality is provided:

- add a sidebar to Wordpress intended for wide advertisements
- add a sidebar to Wordpress intended for Members-only
- modifications to the BuddyPress page template (removed comments
  section)
- add a widget that displays the current logged-in member's expiration
  date (if applicable)
- add a shortcode for use in content areas that displays the current
  logged-in member's expiration date (if applicable)

TODO:

- add logic and hooks to adjust s2Member EOT dates to align with
  Xpressions membership rules
- draw CSS / JS out of the Pagelines custom code areas into the theme
- visuals!
